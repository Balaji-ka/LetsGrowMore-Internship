# About LetsGrowMore

LetsGrowMore is a ground-based organization that aims at building the future through nourishing the present. LetsGrowMore believe in making our youth especially the students self-aware and exploring the untouched world of technology and tremendous growth-making fields .
The tasks were given as follows:

## BEGINNER LEVEL TASK : Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
## INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TASK: Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset – Terrorism
## ADVANCED LEVEL TASK: Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting
I have  successfully completed the first 2 tasks — Beginner Level, and Intermediate Level. I learned a lot during my internship period. This gave me an opportunity to create some new elements which I had never created before. I really enjoyed it a lot.
I have also created a blog for this Internship.
